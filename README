# PPDLTab


## Presentation

PPDLTab is a tableaux method based satisfiability prover
for the propositional dynamic logic with parallel composition
interpreted in the class of deterministic frames.

This implementation is a proof-of-concept.
Almost no optimizations have been done.


## Usage

This program have been compiled and tested successfully
on Linux amd64 with OCaml version 4.02.1.

Type "make" to produce the executable ./ppdltab.

The program reads PPDL formulas on standart input
and tests them for satisfiability.


## Format

The format of formulas is compatible with
the format used by F. Widmann and R. Gor√©'s PDL prover.
Here is a non formal grammar
(see lexer.mll and parser.mly for a detailed grammar).

<prog> :=
  <prog> + <prog>
  <prog> ; <prog>
  * <prog>
  ? <prog>
  <prog> || <prog>
  <ident>

<form> :=
  <form> <=> <form>
  <form>  => <form>
  <form>  |  <form>
  <form>  &  <form>
  < <prog> > <form>
  [ <prog> ] <form>
  ~ <form>
  True
  False
  <ident>

<ident> only contains characters from [a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, '].

Parentheses can be used in both programs and formulas
to avoid ambiguities.
For examples, look at the formulas directory.
